# Starter pack

## Goal üéØ

Develop a web-app, including the following features :

-   Feature description

![App screenshot]()

## Prerequisites ‚ö†Ô∏è

-   NodeJS (v12+ should be fine)

## How to run ? ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

In order to run the app, please reproduce the following steps :

1. Dependencies

##### `npm install`

##### `npm install -g serve`

2. Run app

#### Production (faster speed)

##### `npm run build`

##### `npm run serve-prod`

#### Development (optional)

##### `npm run start`

3. Access app

#### Main page

Open a web browser and access http://localhost:3000/.

#### Specific pages (routing)

-   You can access ... from URL with `http://localhost:3000/...?={?}`. Example : http://localhost:3000/...

3. Run tests

##### `npm run test` (Tests)

## Structure üß±

The sources are composed of multiple folders :

-   `__tests__` (Unit tests)
-   `app` (Root component of the app)
-   `components` (Folders of all components of the app)
-   `constants` (Constants of actions, api)
-   `redux` (Store, actions & reducers)
-   `utils` (Common functions & tools)

x main components :

-   `?` (description)

Logic is separated from view.

## Styles üëÅÔ∏è

Graphic elements are managed with SASS preprocessor and SCSS. It is responsive for wide & small screens. The responsive style is applied for a screen width < 800px. Global variables and mixins are defined in the App.scss file.

![Responsive](?)

## Redux ‚öõÔ∏è

Redux is used to manage actions & data persistency.
There are 3 main reducers :

-   ? : reducer description

![Redux tree](?)

## Unit tests ‚úîÔ∏è

Tests have been coded with Jest and are available in the `__tests__` folder.

As logic is in a 'container' component, that renders a unique display element, it it possible to test logic & view separately.

-   Logic : Test dom output using a mocked redux initial state (if needed)
-   View : Test dom output using different props value. Also, as callbacks are passed to the display element props, it is pretty easy to test if they're succesfully called after a user interaction.

## Performances üìà

This project is made with webpack and babel. A web server is used for development, with hot reload and source maps.
Configuration files have been customized to optimize performances, including management of :

-   polyfills (js & jsx)
-   stylesheets, images, svg and other files loading/compression
-   minification
-   code splitting

## SEO, accessibility üîç

Few attributes have been added to index.html, in order to take into account SEO.

## Good practices üìã

### Eslint

-   Rules are loaded from the .eslintrc configuration file.
